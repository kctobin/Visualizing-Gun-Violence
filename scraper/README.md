## SCRAPER

This implementation is based on the tutorial for Scrapy. It uses Selenium web
driver to interact with the page.

### Execution

Sample script to crawl results for 2016 Q1.
Make sure that the `quarter` and `year` variables in `query_spider.py` are
updated accordingly.

```bash

cd scraper/src/gva/spiders

 scrapy crawl gva -o results/2016/q1.json --loglevel INFO --logfile results/2016/q1.log

```

### Results

Results can be found under results folder, collated by year.
Each file contains an array of incident details. A sample incident detail can
be seen below.

```json
{
  "incident_date": "January 21, 2016",
